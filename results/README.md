### 2023-09-12
This folder contains the first instance of Padel descriptors and a backup of 2856 rows of data generated from `molecules.csv`, which is located in the ../data/2023-09-09 directory.

### 2023-09-13
This directory contains PNG images derived from the first rounds of machine learning tests, conducted using the Padel descriptors. `Figure_1.png` specifically represents the status after 1000 epochs of the training process.

### 2023-09-16
This directory hosts `model.h5`, which is the model of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network. This model is designed to predict emission maxima using Padel descriptors. The development of these descriptors is recorded in the directory dated 2023-09-13.

### 2023-10-02
This folder constitutes an ongoing experimental attempt to test the accuracy of emission maxima predictions gained from combining descriptors of the chromophores (derived on 2023-09-12) with those of a solvent. Depending on the success of this experiment, this folder may be deprecated in the future.

### Deprecate
This folder contains files and directories marked for deletion. 

### Thesis
This houses a LaTeX document detailing all the content pertaining to the author's thesis. 

### Notebook
'Notebook' is a LaTeX report containing notes related to the development and progress of the project.

This documentation is intended to provide a clear overview of the items within each directory, to assist users in understanding the evolution, experimentation and progress of the project.
